# About

A VR game made using **Unity 2021.3.16f1**

**Target Device**: Meta Oculus Device (Quest or Rift)

WildSnap VR is an exciting and immersive VR app that takes the user on a thrilling adventure through a stunning virtual world filled with real animals. As a photographer on a quest to capture the perfect shot, the user will explore the game's various habitats and environments while learning about the animals that live there. 

# How to play

The main aim of WildSnap VR is for players to learn more about the different type of animals by exploring the in-game world and taking and collecting pictures of every animal and their actions.
