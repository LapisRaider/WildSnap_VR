# How to play

The main aim of WildSnap VR is for players to learn more about the different type of animals by exploring the in-game world and taking and collecting pictures of every animal and their actions. Players can see the photos of animals they have taken or have yet to by looking at the animal dex. The animal dex also shows information and interesting facts about the animals.
